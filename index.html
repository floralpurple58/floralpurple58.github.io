          <h2 id="growth"> It's All About That Growth Mindset</h2>
        
        <p>
        Whether you fail or succeed, feel trapped or free, or are happy or depressed, all depends to some degree on whether you have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.
      

It can be difficult to shift one's mindset, but it is not impossible. But developing a growth mindset is key.

I used to be a glass-half-empty kind of gal. I was a natural pessimist. I still feel this way from time to time... I'm human. But I realized that I don't want negativity to dictate my life, and by changing my mindset, I can appreciate life in all its complexity and its beauty. </p>
<h3>How to Develop or Strengthen a Growth Mindset</h3>
<ol>

 <li>Determine your current mindset: is it a fixed or growth mindset?
</li>
 <li>Appreciate your imperfections. We all have flaws the sooner you can accept this the easier it will be to bounce back.</li>

 <li>"Mistakes" are a learning opportunity A mistake, or a setback doesn't have to be an endgame, nor is it a reflection of your intelligence. Instead, they give you an opportunity to learn and to come out stronger.</li>

 <li> The power of "yet" It's not that you failed; you just didn't reach your goal yet. Keep persevering and staying determined, and if you still haven't reached your goal, you are a lot closer than if you stayed stagnant or retreated. And sometimes, you just have to change your goal. </li>

<li>Learn from others, learn from yourself, learn from other people's successes or setbacks, and learn from yourself; look for ways to grow.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="final">Final Thoughts</h3>

How we think dictates what we do, how we react. Set yourself up for success by cultivating a growth mindset and remember there is always something more to learn about yourself and the world around you. Embrace the growth mindset.

<h2 id="bridging">Bridging Generations</h2>    
<p>  Older adults are living longer making it even more important that people of all generations connect with each other. </p> 

<p>When was the last time that you spent time with someone of a different generation than you? And no family doesn't count.</p> 

<p>In today's society, it is becoming increasingly rare for young and older people to have meaningful connections. Part of the reason is because of how we tend to cluster ourselves within our own age groups. The little interaction between younger and older people can result in prejudice, ageism, and the loss of potentially life-changing experiences.</p>

<p>Another repercussion of the limited interaction is that older generations may be met with disdain. As if they have no value and nothing more to offer. It can happen in their own family too. The saddest thing is when some older individuals start to believe it themselves.</p> 

<p>The truth is whether you are younger or older, <em>you are worthy, you matter and you have something beautiful to give this world. </em> </p>

<h3>Bridging the Generations Benefits Everyone</h3> 

<p>When we bridge the generations, we can create not only a better sense of community but also a better quality of life that benefits everyone. </p>

<p>But how do we connect the generations in a society that seems to be set in our ways?</p>

<p>One of the ways is to let go of preconceived notions that you may have because of a person's age. When interacting with others with an open mind, we see past the stereotypes and appreciate the person an individual.</p>

<p>Another way to increase the connections made between the younger and older generations is through the power of storytelling. Older individuals have years of experience under their belt and can provide insight and solutions especially because many of what they experienced the younger generations are experiencing right now.</p>

<h3 id="last">Final Thoughts on Intergenerational Relationships</h3>

<p>The more exposure we have to people of different generations, the more understanding, and respect we can have for each other while also decrying the ageist and stereotypical attitudes.</p>

<p>Whether you are in your 20s or in your 80s you can gain sense of purpose, fulfillment and pure joy when interacting outside your age group.</p> 

<p>I urge all of you to interact with someone of a different age than you, to begin the process of breaking down the barriers and uniting the generations as one.</p>
